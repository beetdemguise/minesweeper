Minesweeper
-----------

This project is my hopefully accurate clone of the classic Microsoft Windows pass-time, Minesweeper.

I decided to make this clone because:

#. I needed to know more about the primary ideal behind React. I figured this would be a good intro project
#. I really missed playing Minesweeper

Startup is simple:

```bash
$ git clone <repo> minesweeper
$ cd minesweeper
$ npm install
$ ./bin/run
```

Enjoy.
