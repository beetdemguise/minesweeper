Minesweeper
-----------

This project is my hopefully accurate clone of the classic Microsoft Windows pass-time, Minesweeper.

I decided to make this clone because:

1. I needed to know more about the primary ideal behind React. I figured this would be a good intro project
2. I really missed playing Minesweeper


Startup is simple:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/beetdemguise/minesweeper.git minesweeper
$ cd minesweeper
$ npm install
$ ./bin/run
```

Enjoy.
